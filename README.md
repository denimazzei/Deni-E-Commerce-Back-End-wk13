# Deni-E-Commerce-Back-End-wk13

## Description

My task was to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. The goal was to configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

Navigate to the root folder , open an integrated terminal and 'run npm i'.
To create the database, access it within the terminal, intitialize the database with 'mysql -u -root -p' then run 'source schema.sql'. 
Back in the root terminal, seed the database by test running 'npm run seed'.
Then start the server with 'npm start'
NOTE: make sure to modify the .ENV file with your database password and rename the file to remove the "example" from the file name.
